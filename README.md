# CLARIAH Interest Group on Annotation Infrastructure

This repository is intended to organize the work, output and documentation of the CLARIAH Interest Group (IG) on Annotation Infrastructure

## Introduction

The enrichment of various types of data with all kinds of annotations is a shared
interest of several WPs, although requirements may differ greatly depending on the
material to be annotated. The further development of a network of distributed
annotation servers in WP2 calls for close collaboration with WP3, WP5 and WP6,
who have defined several annotation-related tasks.

## Aims of the Interest Group

The aims of the IG on Annotation Infrastructure are:

- foster discussion and knowledge sharing regarding annotation infrastructure
- develop and share best practices
- inform development of CLARIAH annotation tools and services

## Scope of the Interest Group

- support of the creation and use of annotations on any media type
- support of manual annotation processes
- support of manual correction of automatic annotation
- ...

Annotation aspects that are outside the scope of this Interest Group (because they are covered by other IGs):

- automatic annotation processes
- crowdsourcing
- ...


## Communication

We use the following communication channel:

- gitter?

## Tasks

Annotation infrastructure problems that we try to tackle are:

- storage and distribution
- querying
- interoperability
- provenance and context of creation
- shared libraries of basic annotation components
- choosing standards
