# Inventory of Annotation Models, Formats, Converters used in CLARIAH

[Back to main page](./README.md)

This document provides an inventory of the annotation models, paradigms, formats and converters used in CLARIAH. Eventually, we aim to create recommendations based on this inventory.

## Annotation Models

### Generic Annotation Models:

- [W3C Web Annotation Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/): this model connects the Interest Group on Annotation with the Interest Group on Linked Open Data.

### Text Annotation Models

- [TEI](https://tei-c.org) (Text Encoding Initiative) -  An international and widely used encoding method for
    machine-readable text, chiefly in the humanities, social sciences and linguistics. Used by various CLARIAH partners.
- [FoLiA](https://proycon.github.io/folia/) (Format for Linguistic Annotation) - A generic paradigm and XML-based format for encoding linguistic annotation on text, aimed at the storage and exchange of linguistically annotated documents. The goal is to deliver a practical format with rich tooling infrastructure. Used by various CLARIAH partners, various dutch corpora, and developed/maintained in WP3.
